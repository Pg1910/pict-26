# 🏦 Explainable Transaction Anomaly Monitoring System

*(Hackathon Submission Document)*

---

## 1. Problem Statement (What We Are Solving)

Modern banking systems must **monitor transactions in real time** to identify:

* Fraud
* Account misuse
* Suspicious behavior

However:

* Fraud labels are **rare, delayed, or noisy**
* Models must be **explainable**
* Systems must **work offline** and be **auditable**

### Our Goal

Build an **explainable, rule-based transaction monitoring system** that:

* Flags **high-risk anomalous transactions**
* Explains **why** a transaction is flagged
* Works even when **user history is sparse**
* Can be **demonstrated offline**

---

## 2. Key Design Principles (Why Our Approach)

| Principle                     | Reason                                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Explainability first          | Required in banking & regulation              |
| No black-box ML               | Judges and auditors must understand decisions |
| Offline-capable               | Real bank systems run in secure networks      |
| Multi-signal logic            | Fraud is rarely detected from one feature     |
| Simulation for stress testing | To demonstrate readiness                      |

---

## 3. Dataset Overview

* **Rows**: ~150,000 transactions
* **Users**: ~138,000 (very sparse per user)
* **Key fields**:

  * Transaction amount
  * Timestamp
  * Sender / receiver
  * Device, IP, location
  * Behavioral scores
  * Fraud label (used only for validation)

### Important Observation

Most users have **1–2 transactions**, so:

* Traditional velocity rules **do not naturally trigger**
* We must design for **low-history users**

---

## 4. Feature Engineering (What Signals We Use)

We engineered **bank-standard risk signals**.

### 4.1 Amount Deviation

**Question:** Is this amount unusual *for this user*?

* We compute a **user-level z-score**
* Moderate deviation (z ≥ 1) is meaningful in sparse data

✔ Explainable
✔ User-relative

---

### 4.2 New Device Detection

**Question:** Has this user used this device before?

* First-time device → higher risk
* Repeated device → lower risk

✔ Common in banking
✔ High signal for account takeover

---

### 4.3 New IP Address

**Question:** Is the network context new?

* New IP = unfamiliar environment
* Used as a **weak signal**, not alone

✔ Explainable
✔ Network-level risk

---

### 4.4 Location Change

**Question:** Has the transaction city changed since last time?

* Sudden changes increase risk
* First transaction is treated as “unknown location”

✔ Behavioral consistency check

---

### 4.5 Off-Hour Activity

**Question:** Is this transaction happening at an unusual time for the user?

* We compute each user’s **dominant transaction hour**
* Deviations are flagged

✔ Time-based behavioral anomaly

---

### 4.6 Velocity Anomaly (Simulation Mode)

**Problem:** Dataset is sparse → velocity does not naturally appear

**Solution:**

* We introduce **simulation mode**
* Create short-lived “attack sessions”
* Detect **multiple transactions in a short time window**

✔ Clearly labeled as simulation
✔ Demonstrates system readiness

---

## 5. Risk Signal Conversion

Each feature becomes a **binary risk flag**:

| Signal               | Meaning                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| risk_amount          | Unusual amount                       |
| risk_new_device      | First-time device                    |
| risk_new_ip          | First-time IP                        |
| risk_location_change | Location changed                     |
| risk_off_hour        | Unusual transaction time             |
| risk_velocity_sim    | Rapid transaction burst (simulation) |

Each signal is **weak alone**, strong when combined.

---

## 6. Risk Scoring Logic (Explainable Core)

We use a **transparent additive model**.

```
Risk Score = Sum of active risk signals
```

* No weights
* No black box
* Easy to audit

### Risk Interpretation

| Risk Score | Meaning                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 0–2        | Low risk                |
| 3          | Medium (novel behavior) |
| 4          | High risk               |
| 5+         | Critical risk           |

---

## 7. Two-Layer Decision Engine (Why This Matters)

### Layer 1 — Anomaly Detection

* Flags transactions with **multiple risk signals**
* Broad monitoring layer

### Layer 2 — Confirmation (Noise Reduction)

A transaction is **confirmed anomalous** if:

* Risk score ≥ threshold **AND**
* Strong behavioral evidence (high amount percentile or off-hour)

✔ Reduces false positives
✔ Mirrors real bank workflows

---

## 8. Final Output (What the System Produces)

Each transaction gets:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "...",
  "risk_score": 4,
  "is_anomalous": true,
  "reasons": [
    "New device detected",
    "New IP address detected",
    "Transaction at unusual time"
  ]
}
```

✔ Human-readable
✔ Audit-ready
